# Solend Public

Solend public is a monorepo of public reposititories meant to benefit from a yarn workspace setup. This includes:

- Solend SDK, a Typescript SDK for interacting with the Solend program
- Solend LITE, a lightweight open-source Solend client, powered by and developed alongside the Solend SDK
- Solend Liquidator, a starting point for the Solend community to build their liquidator bots
